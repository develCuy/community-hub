Welcome! We're thrilled you're launching on Rollux. 

If you haven't filled out the [get started form](https://wkf.ms/43MUo0C) please do so prior to reading this.

We are excited for your deployment onto Rollux! 
You will be welcomed by a great community 🫂🫂. Make sure to jump into the `#🔨│builder-general` [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux/) channel ⚙️⚙️!

The business development team gets a flurry of inbound messages and contact requests every day and we reply to them as efficiently as possible, but we are only human! 
Please be patient if you are in need of direct support. 
We cannot always provide direct help, but we strive to help everyone succeed on Rollux through the various resources we provide to projects. 


## Developer Support 🙋💻

Steps to take if you would like developer support immediately, ranked in order of response times. 

1. See our [Developer Documentation](../developers/) and [Tutorials](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux-tutorial).
1. Head over to `🤖│dev-support` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollux/) for the fastest help 


## Marketing Requests 🦸🦸

When your project is deployed on Rollux, you can be added to [our ecosystem page](https://rollux.com/ecosystem). 
Simply [fill out this form]() to request to be included. Inclusion is at our discretion.

### Tweeting

We do occasionally retweet but we try to keep the bar high for these as our Twitter feed must be kept as valuable/high signal as possible. 
Other than RT's, we may like or reply to a tweet or include it in a development update or Syscoin might add it to the Syscoin Weekly blog+tweet. 
You're welcome to submit your tweet for amplification but please keep in mind if and how we interact with it is at our sole discretion.

### Promoting Values before anything else

We love to promote values-aligned projects as part of our broader content program.





### OPRadio

We also host a weekly Twitter Space in an interview/podcast format called OP Radio. You're welcome to express interest in being featured on OP Radio, but keep in mind that we maintain the final say on whether it makes sense or not.

 
## Governance Grants

Grants are mainly handled by [The Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement), our open governance system/digital society. If you are interested in applying, we first recommend the following: 
 
- Check that your application falls within the possible Governance Grant categories in the [OPerating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types).
- Deploy to Optimism (we are [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), not just EVM compatible so it is very easy to deploy). 
  Check out our [getting started tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started) to see how to deploy. We also have [tons of more in-depth tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial) for bridging and other L2 specific functionality. 
- Try gaining organic traction:
  - Traction can be gained through our community.
  - Head over to [our discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) and check out [#showandtell](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/819333988719263774) or [#demoday](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/960493820674465883).
  Demo Day is an AMA about your product to our community. Apply in Discord. 
  - Seek synergies – look at other teams already deployed on Optimism that could work with your product and reach out to them.
- Once you have done the above, check out our [governance grant process](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233).
- To get reviews in real time from governance delegates go to discord and post about your project in [#temp-check](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1011238484373159956).
